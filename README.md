# Airlines-Flights-Data
This project performs insightful analysis of airline flight booking data using SQL. The dataset includes real-world flight details such as airline names, departure and arrival cities, prices and travel times (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening, night). All analysis is done using pure SQL queries to extract trends and understand pricing patterns.
